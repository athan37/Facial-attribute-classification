# Facial Attribute Classification
## Duc Anh Than and Sammy Sasaki

## Abstract

Facial attribute classification is the task of predicting attributes or characteristics of a person's face, such as gender, age, or facial expression. This repository provides an implementation of a facial attribute classification system using deep learning techniques.

Our system is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which takes an input image and outputs a set of attribute predictions. The CNN is trained on a large-scale dataset of labeled facial images, and we use transfer learning to fine-tune the pre-trained network for our specific task.

We evaluate the performance of our system on a test set of facial images, and report accuracy and other relevant metrics. We also provide scripts to visualize the predictions of our system on new facial images.
